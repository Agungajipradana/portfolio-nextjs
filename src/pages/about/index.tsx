              Driven by a desire for continuous learning, I recently completed a Fullstack NodeJS Bootcamp at PT Code Development Indonesia. During this intensive program, I had the chance to work on exciting projects, including the
              creation of the Realta Hotel using NextJs and NestJs, with a PostgreSQL database and styled with Tailwind CSS. My experience in this bootcamp has further solidified my foundation in web development.
